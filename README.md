# lt-plugin

A Leiningen template to generate LightTable plugin projects.

## Usage

From your LightTable plugins folder, run:

`lein new lt-plugin myplugin`

NOTE - this is not on Clojars yet, so until then, you need to clone this repo and run the command above from
this projects directory.  The generated plugin project will be created in a subfolder ('myplugin' in the example above)
which you can then move to your LightTable plugin directory.

This is only temporary - once more testing is done, I will publish the plugin to clojars so it will "just work".

## Building

* Add the `myplugin` folder to LightTable and open the `myplugin.cljs` file.

* Run the command `Editor: Build file or project` (you should see "Compiled plugin to ...myplugin_compiled.js" in the statusbar)

To load/reload the plugin:

* Run the command `Plugins: Refresh plugin list`
* Run the command `App: Reload behaviors`

The plugin will also be loaded on restarting Light Table.

## Testing

* Run the command `myplugin: Say Hello`
